# NLP_Project_3_Multilingual_Semantic_Role_Labeling
In this project we explore the concept of “semantic role labeling” (who did what to whom) for sentences in French. English semantic role labeling has been heavily studied for decades. However, porting semantic role labeling to non-English languages requires training on the non-English language to create a new model for that language.
